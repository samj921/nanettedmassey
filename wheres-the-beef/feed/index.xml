					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://samj921.github.io/nanettedmassey/wheres-the-beef/#comment-41&quot;&gt;Frank Staropoli&lt;/a&gt;.

Wow Frank. I really didn&#039;t expect this to get back to you so soon. And I certainly didn&#039;t expect such an open hearted response. I did originally write this on your page as a response to &quot;Layer Upon Layer&quot; (https://staropoli.com/2019/11/11/layer-upon-layer-uncovering-bias/). Guess I didn&#039;t hit the button right to make it happen. I&#039;m honestly still SO clueless about how this whole inter-web thing works. I give you my permission to take this and re-post it for your next entry as a guest submission.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nanette, from the beginning, I&#039;ve appreciated your writing.  You get right to it, and in creative, expressive ways.  I presume I&#039;m the &quot;Frank&quot; you mean, but I never saw these comments appear in reply to my post.  I&#039;d like my readers to see this too.  So if you would, please reply there.
Yes, this is the same message Howard has been conveying.  I tried to make it clear at the end of the post that the whole point of this &quot;work&quot; is to check the impact of all our white stuff so it doesn&#039;t infect our action, to give us a way to measure that.  But I get that thinking about all that is still not ACTION itself.  That&#039;s why I&#039;d like you to post this comment to my blog.  Better yet:  Howard wrote a guest essay for my blog about a year ago.  Would you be willing to contribute this post - or some version of it - as a guest blog?  It would be due to come out Dec.10.  If you leave it as a reply on my blog now, I doubt that anyone is going to see it.  It&#039;s late.  But all subscribers would see it next post.  What do you think?]]></description>
