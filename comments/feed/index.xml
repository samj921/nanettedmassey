					<description><![CDATA[Wow. So sorry he did not see the value in what you were offering. And the trauma Black women suffered that you describe is written in a way that sickens me in the gut and wrenches my heart. I know that is only a fraction of what you and other Black women feel so there is no way I can imagine what that pain must feel like. There are not sufficient words to say more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent writing about a disturbing but not shocking incident. Why is it so difficult for people to understand their own racism and the mental abuse it causes? This total lack of insight and empathy is why you are so necessary! Please never give up trying to break through. We are all lucky to have the benefit of your mission.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apparently you’re not from Rochester or you’d know Howard lived and went to school in Penfield. Granted his living conditions weren&#039;t the best as his parents were agricultural workers and they lived in one of the outhouses . You would also know that the 64 riots started out as a block party and someone got out of hand and the citizens there called the police . When they went to arrest him the girlfriend victim recanted her story and riled up the crowd . I was a baby and lived  a couple blocks down . I lived in the city till the early nineties. In the hood . What’s the graduation rate among black folks in Rochester and what is the single parent percentage ? The only institutional or structural racism is in your head .]]></description>
