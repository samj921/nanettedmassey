					<description><![CDATA[I received this by email:

 Hi! I&#039;m Lesley from Facebook who commented on a post with you the other day. I finally got a chance to read your blog and I wanted to thank you for putting in the time and energy to send these posts out into the world. I especially appreciate the post about &quot;my black son, it&#039;s all about me&quot;. That is something I&#039;m trying to be acutely aware of these days, especially on facebook, and especially regarding race (I&#039;m white, and UU, and we are deep in it internally). See what I did there, made it all about me lol. So, thank you and I look forward to following your blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the analogy really works to make your point. The intro about fitness trainers wanting to experience what it’s like to be fat was a good hook. It showed clearly how the focus was shifted unfairly from the client to the trainer. Another example are testimonies from transgender people that basically amount to: sexism is real, and living as a woman is harder than living as a man. Narratives along the lines of: now that I am a woman, my decisions are questioned, I am spoken to as if stupid etc, or: now that I am a man, people laugh at my jokes, apparently becoming male made me funny. I already knew that sexism is real, although there is some value in having it confirmed out loud. 
Your point is well-taken that this newfound understanding or empathy in and of itself is not solving the issue, is not solving inequality, although i suppose it can be a first step. In fact, it probably has to be the first step, but one needs to remember that then there are other steps that follow. The intended outcome is not for everyone to REALIZE that systems of inequality exist or to develop empathy with the oppressed, but the outcome must be CHANGING the status quo in some way for the better. It&#039;s a good reminder about how not just be annoyingly unhelpful, which admittedly, sometimes is hard. Thanks for this piece!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice picture that seems to set the underlying tone to understand. There was no hostility and only curiosity and willingness to know. The fat lead in was more universal and the lead into understanding and caring about racial issues was on target.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Nanette, those stories helped me understand how not to be.  Sometimes in conversations I want to show that we all have the same feelings and want to be listened to and cared about. It should not be about me.
