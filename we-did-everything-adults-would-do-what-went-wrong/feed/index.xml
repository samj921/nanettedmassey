					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading the experience you wrote about the baby learning to walks. “ What was so humorously beautiful about that encounter for me was witnessing this child noticing our difference, but with a complete lack of needing that difference to mean anything.”  This is exactly what racism is. People basically place a negative meaning to the differences of our skin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Beautifully written description of how racism is learned and perpetuated.  Thank you, Nanette.  I think too many of us forget just how smart and how resilient the ordinary kid is.  It&#039;s the adults who are afraid of telling truth and encouraging, demanding and enforcing respect on the part of the young. It may be worth noting that in a world of changing demographics such as ours, parents who fail to deal with this basic reality are doing their kids no favors.&quot;

                                                                                                                                          N. Wasko   Vermont, USA]]></description>

It is important to get both your perspective and the facts out there for all of us to learn how the world exists and what more progression is needed.]]></description>

&quot;...they are curious, smarter than we even imagine, and desperately want to &#039;fit in.&#039;&#039; You said it, Peggy. &quot;Miss Massey&quot; would have made me feel too old though.

&quot;Miss Nan&quot;--ha, ha, ha. I&#039;m hesitant to blame the mother solely. That makes it too easy for us to have one &quot;villain&quot; to assign the whole mess to. She was as much a victim of white supremacy and white ignorance as the little boy in that she too was like a deer stuck in headlights and was a) surprised that such a comment would come out of the mouth of her boy and b) at an immediate loss for words on how to even out this situation. I&#039;m not &quot;letting her off the hook,&quot; just saying her belief in herself as a progressive &quot;good white person&quot; probably caught her as off guard as I at the notion that the fruit of her loins would say something like that. We think too much in our culture that it&#039;s one influence/person/thing that, having gotten rid of it/him/her, we&#039;ve done all the work necessary. I&#039;m worried that now that Donald Trump has been voted out of office, many white people will wash their hands and think &quot;good job on us! O.K., we&#039;re done.&quot; That would be a sad waste of all the Donald Trump opposition that waited hours in the lines to vote.]]></description>
