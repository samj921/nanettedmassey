					<description><![CDATA[Apparently you’re not from Rochester or you’d know Howard lived and went to school in Penfield. Granted his living conditions weren&#039;t the best as his parents were agricultural workers and they lived in one of the outhouses . You would also know that the 64 riots started out as a block party and someone got out of hand and the citizens there called the police . When they went to arrest him the girlfriend victim recanted her story and riled up the crowd . I was a baby and lived  a couple blocks down . I lived in the city till the early nineties. In the hood . What’s the graduation rate among black folks in Rochester and what is the single parent percentage ? The only institutional or structural racism is in your head .]]></description>
