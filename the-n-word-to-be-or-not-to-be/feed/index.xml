					<description><![CDATA[I cannot count how many times I&#039;ve had to explain to other White people that it&#039;s not our word to use or regulate.  The most recent involved an incident between youth athletes.  Another parent was expressing their dismay that &quot;that kind of thing still happens in 2020.&quot;  But, then they followed  up with, &quot;Some of the blame has to be placed on them for still using the word in their own community.&quot;    I set aside the &quot;us vs them&quot; pretext because there just wasn&#039;t time to unpack that with a parent that had been pre-gaming in the parking lot.  But, I did explain that it&#039;s not our word to use and it&#039;s not our word to regulate.  I explained that there was a time when it was our word, when we invented it&#039;s meaning and used it as a weapon of oppression and because of that, we have forfeited any authority we have over it&#039;s continued usage. 

I offer that story not looking for an &quot;attaboy&quot;, but for any White folks passing through.  That explanation cut through the willful ignorance. I think part of &quot;well-meaning&quot; White people&#039;s complex relationship with the word stems from the fact it serves as a reminder of atrocities that would be far more convenient for White folks to forget. 

On an unrelated note:  I still say, &quot;Lemme show you somethin&#039;&quot; in fire marshal Bill&#039;s voice and had to dig up a video on You-Tube to explain it to my kids.]]></description>
