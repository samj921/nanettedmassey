					<description><![CDATA[Love it, Dr. Nanette. I just got through viewing several episodes of &quot;Dope&quot;, a NETFLIX showing a reality of drugs in the US and connections with Canada and other countries. This episode had much to do with younger people and the issues so many of them face directly tied to racial oppression as well as economic oppression. In fact, this epidemic crosses all lines. Jessie Jackson&#039;s euphemism of &quot;Keeping Hope Alive&quot; seems not a wasted one as a much needed rallying cry. Hope for anything long-term, seems somewhat hopeless for far too many, and especially with this person-in chief that runs the country. IMO Be glad when your workshops might be podcast or other.]]></description>
