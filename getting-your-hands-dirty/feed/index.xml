					<description><![CDATA[Dear Nannette,  I can&#039;t wait to meet you but truth be told, I don&#039;t know any black people I can call friends, I want to get my hands dirty---I want to be a part of  what matters, I live in a senior apartment complex now, sort of upscale like the suburbs but I only see white people here. I loved one black person, my sister Christine Ellington&#039;s husband Jim. Your writing is lucid. crystal-clear and important. Geraldine Wierzbicki-Roach]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nanette, 
I appreciated meeting you at the talk last night along with the welcome chance to see and read The Challenger [newspaper, Buffalo] again. What&#039;s more, I found your review of _Love in the Driest Season_, part critique, and part revealing personal chronicle, to be intelligently written as well as forthright and brave. 
I wish you continued success.

					<description><![CDATA[From Pat Burke:  I liked the article Getting Your hands Dirty. I feel lucky because I get to meet people of different backgrounds at the Y where I exercise in the pool and you can talk to folks while you move around in the pool or the hot tub. VOICE Buffalo also helps me learn more about people of color and I hope they get to know me too. The older I get the more curious I get about people in general, especially when I go to memorial services and realize that these people were in my church and I did not take the time to know them better, until I went to the funeral.]]></description>
