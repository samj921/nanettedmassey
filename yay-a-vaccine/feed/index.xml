					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Nanette for this incredibly detailed and thorough summary; I am thankful to have come across your post and hope others may find knowledge and historical truth that is evident here as well. Agreed with prior post; this is beyond shameful. I should hope that this country looks upon its past and understand the pain and trauma that this caused (...because, yes, we are beginning to see remnants of this again today).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Nanette.  And the myth that Blacks have a higher pain tolerance continues to this day.  Fifty percent of today&#039;s White medical students and residents hold these biased beliefs. ( https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296 ) And these are the folks who represent the &quot;best and brightest&quot; among the supposedly more inclusion-minded younger generation.  Med students, no less, ostensibly receiving cutting edge education, not reading musty 19th Century texts written by former bloodletters.  Mix that into the historical context you summarize and vaccine caution among Blacks is only logical. Thank you for shining more light onto the dark reality of White Supremacy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nanette, 

I knew a little about the surgeries without anesthesia, and of course about Tuskeegee.  And I&#039;ll never forget what Henrietta Lacks did for the entire world; with no recognition or recompense.  While I was unable to benefit from her contribution to polio vaccinations, so very many, many others have.  And of course, I benefitted from other vaccines.  And of course, all a part of my/our white privilege.  Disgusting, outrageous, shameful, but not surprising. 

Thanks for sharing, 

yours, 

Janine
