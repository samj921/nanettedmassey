Great use of Slow Roll!!  I see it in Detroit too.  However, seeing color is what makes it interesting... You can then see the similarities once you acknowledge that difference.  (Sometimes that nails on chalkboard to hear &quot;I don&#039;t see color&quot;)]]></description>

To expand a bit on Slow Roll. 

Two years ago a blogger claimed Slow Roll was basically a voyeuristic adventure for privileged folks from the suburbs to inconvenience urban neighborhoods and gawk at the dilapidated housing. I took exception to that, explaining how Slow Roll provided opportunities for informal interaction with people of diverse backgrounds, resulting in acquaintances with people one would be unlikely to meet in the normal course of events, especially in a highly segregated city like Buffalo. In other words, Slow Roll creates the conditions for the possibility of friendships with people of other backgrounds, including race. This is especially true among the Squad, the 100 or so volunteers who plan the ride, guide and accompany the riders, block off traffic at intersections, and host the after party.

Since joining Squad, I&#039;ve met many African-American cyclists, and have been invited to their house for a beer, gone to wakes of their loved ones, gone bowling with them, and simply hung out with them. I won&#039;t say &quot;Some of my best friends are black!&quot; but I will say that the number of black persons I know by name, and who know me, is many times higher than it would be if I weren&#039;t on Slow Roll.

Full disclosure: I&#039;ve spent most of the past 30 years as a priest and friar in racially diverse parishes and neighborhoods. So in that capacity  I have gotten to know more black, Hispanic, and Asian persons than white people. Yet I almost have to do that as a priest. 

On Slow Roll, I don&#039;t wear my habit or clerical garb that would identify me as clergy. Though many Slow Rollers know who I am, when I ride through neighborhoods the week before the ride to scout out the route for road hazards, I interact with a wide variety of people on their porches or on their sidewalks. On over 75 of these rides, which can be in the morning, afternoon, or evening, I&#039;ve been on almost every street in the city of Buffalo. I&#039;m a random white guy on an old bike with an orange Slow Roll shirt on, asking folks if they know that hundreds of bikes will be coming down their street the next Monday night. I&#039;ve probably interacted with over 1,000 neighbors. Not once have I been verbally abused or made to feel unwelcome because of my race. Yes, some people don&#039;t like that we&#039;ll be clogging their street for 20 minutes. But nobody has said &quot;Go back to the suburbs&quot; (I live in the city, anyway). Though I won&#039;t declare &quot;I don&#039;t see color,&quot; perhaps subconsciously I&#039;m sending off signals that thanks to my life experience I have a comfort level that other white people might not have. I can be sure that Slow Roll has increased that comfort level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Years ago in Detroit I attended a progressive Black church and organized a couples club made up of mostly professionals.  The assistant minister got an inquiry from a suburban church to establish a dialogue and meetings.  We met about 4 times. They were not sophisticated at all even though they were college graduates.  We tried house parties, picnics, etc and everyone hung out with their group.  It became a waste of time.   In retrospect more effort should have been made selecting folks with similar interests and backgrounds. Also a more structured setting and agenda would help. Good luck David
